<h1>Hangman in C++</h1>
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game Hangman in C++. In this game, one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn. The game continues until either the word is correctly guessed or the stick figure is completely drawn, at which point the player loses.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
A C++ compiler
<h2>How to Play</h2>
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/hemanth-kumar-boddeda/HangMan-Console-Game/blob/main/HangMan/hangman.cpp

Navigate to the repository directory and compile the program using the following command:

Copy code
g++ -o hangman hangman.cpp
Run the program using the following command:
bash
Copy code
./hangman
The game will prompt the player who thinks of the word to input the word. The other player will then take turns guessing letters. The game will display the number of incorrect guesses and a representation of the stick figure, which is updated after each incorrect guess. The game will end when either the word is correctly guessed or the stick figure is completely drawn.
<h2>Documentation</h2>
The code is well-commented and should be easy to understand for someone with some experience in C++. If you have any questions or comments about the code, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
